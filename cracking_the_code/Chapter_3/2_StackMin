Chapter 03 | Problem 02 - Stack Min

Problem Statement:
  How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function
  min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in 0(1) time.
"""

Solution:
  Inside Stack, create an array that stores min elements in order. If an element is pushed,
  update the array if it's smaller than current min element. If an element is
  popped and is an min element, update the array also.
