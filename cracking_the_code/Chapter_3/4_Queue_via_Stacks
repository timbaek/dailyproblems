Chapter 03 | Problem 04 - Queue via Stacks

Problem Statement:
  Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue using two stacks.
"""

Solution:
  Initially use one stack to store all items incoming. When pop is called,
  pop out all elements from the first stack and push onto the second stack.
  If last element is popped from first stack, return that as a pop.
