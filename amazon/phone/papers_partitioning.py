'''
Given p papers of varying lengths, each of which take a proportionate time to process and given k graders.
Distribute papers among the graders to minimize total time to grade all papers.

It is similar with divide chocolate minimize maximum, but in this case, can be any order.

Example:

Input: papers = [10, 13, 12, 18, 10], k = 2
Output: 32

Explanation: 
  min_sum([10, 10, 12], [13, 18]) 
  but not 35 => min_sum([10, 13, 12], [18, 10])

  pass
